# octoprint_install
Maintaining two scripts was a lot of work, therefore, the octoprint_install script has reached end-of-life and has now been archived. The octoprint_deploy script can now do all the things of octoprint_install and much more. The current script, if run, will prompt to clone octoprint_deploy which can be found here: https://github.com/paukstelis/octoprint_deploy
